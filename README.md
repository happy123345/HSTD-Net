## Data Access Instructions
Due to the confidentiality and authorization requirements associated with the industrial monitoring data used in this project, access is managed through a controlled process. This helps ensure compliance with data agreements and allows us to notify users of important updates or revisions.
# This data package includes the following three components:
(1)Two complete public benchmark datasets: Standard data for model comparison and validation.

(2)Pump station actual operation data subset: Industrial data containing 4,500 continuous time-series samples (processed for outliers using the 3σ method, not standardized), which can be used to reproduce the core experiments of the paper.

If you wish to use the dataset for academic or research purposes, please follow these steps:
